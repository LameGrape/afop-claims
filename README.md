# AFOP CLAIMS

why did i call this afop claims? idk

## instructions

whenever you update your country's claims, upload the new claims image to here. make sure the claims image has the exact same file name as the previous claims image for your country.

## faq

### what if my country doesnt have any claims yet?

when you make your first claim, upload it here and make sure the filename is the name of your country.

### what if my country changes its name?

stay on the old file. you should only move to a new file if your country becomes a completely new country, e.g. it died then was reborn as a different country.

### what if my country disappears?

do not delete the image. any dead countries should not be updated any more, unless they come back to life.

### is there a specific style i must use?

no, but make sure its very clear where your claims are and consistency is a good idea. keeping the map inthe exact same position and size will also help. try to avoid thick and ambiguous lines. if you arent able to make the claims image yourself, get somebody else to do it.
